**AlgoSphere** is an interactive web application meticulously crafted to simulate and visualize fundamental **Operating System algorithms**. Our focus lies in providing an intuitive understanding of **Page Replacement Algorithms** and **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**, making complex concepts accessible to students and professionals alike through engaging, hands-on interaction.

Built with the power of **Streamlit**, the versatility of **Python**, and the visualization prowess of **Matplotlib**, AlgoSphere delivers dynamic experiences and real-time feedback.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÑ Page Replacement Algorithms

* **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Understand the simplicity of the first-come, first-served approach.
* **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Explore how keeping track of recent usage impacts page faults.
* **Optimal**: Witness the theoretical best-case scenario in page replacement.

### üñ•Ô∏è CPU Scheduling Algorithms

* **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**: Grasp the basics of non-preemptive scheduling.
* **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Analyze how prioritizing shorter tasks can improve throughput.
* **RR (Round Robin)**: Observe fair resource allocation through time slicing.
* **Priority Scheduling**: Learn how assigning priorities influences process execution.

### üìä Engaging Visualizations

* **Gantt Charts**: Visualize the timeline of CPU allocation for scheduling algorithms.
* **Pie Charts**: Gain insights into the efficiency of page replacement algorithms through hit/miss ratios.
* **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow the logic of each algorithm in a clear, sequential manner.
